# Habit: Session-End Capture

## Trigger

Before ending a Claude session, especially after:
- Fixing a tricky problem
- Learning something new about the config
- Creating a new pattern or convention

## Action

Ask: "Anything worth capturing to the playbook?"

If yes:
1. **Knowledge** - Document how something works
2. **Runbook** - Document how to do something
3. **Habit** - Document a behavior to remember

Write to appropriate file and commit.

## Why

Knowledge captured during the session is fresh and accurate. Waiting until later means:
- Details get forgotten
- It feels like extra work
- It often doesn't happen

Capture as a byproduct of the work, not as a separate task.

## Example

After fixing MiniSessions loading the wrong project:
- Created `knowledge/mini-sessions.md` explaining cwd paths
- Captured the solution while it was fresh
- Next time this comes up, the knowledge is there
