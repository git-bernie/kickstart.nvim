    Gclog --name-only Gets my list of files, but it isn't interactive.

    The author of the plugin said that it is their long term goal to make the
    commit objects look and behave like the summary window. However, until that
    is implemented I can achieve a workflow similar to my request by

    Opening the commit object but with foldmethod set to syntax. This will fold
    the diffs and have each file on a separate line. Can also use [m and ]m to
    move the cursor between files in the commit object.

    Open files by pressing o instead of Enter, this will open them in a split and
    not the current window.
